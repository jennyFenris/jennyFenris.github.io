		<h1>Triggers</h1>
		<h3>How did the trigger training exercises feel?</h3>
		<p>Robotic i think? logical.. obvious course of action.</p>



		<h3>Did you notice any responses in yourself.</h3>
		<p>I think im very good at catching my emotions and thinking about how i should feel or what i think is right. I do not always act out what im thinking though and proberly semi conscience of it XD.</p>
		<p>I used to cry alot as a child over stupid things. Very sensitive T.T and trained myself not to for a very very long time still training.</p>





		<h3>What emotion do you want to befriend.</h3>
		<p>Perhaps being excessively angry with myself. Irrational anxiety.</p>
