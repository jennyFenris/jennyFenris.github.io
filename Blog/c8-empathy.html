	<h1>Empathy</h1>

	<h3>Try "Just Like Me" and "Loving Kindness" practices. How did you feel?</h3>

	<p>"Whatever one frequently thinks and ponders upon, that will become the inclination of his mind". Trying the first practice called Just like me, in which we remind ourselves how smiliar other people are to us(mental habit of equality). It feel like its easier to connect with other people.</p>

	<p>Loving Kindness meditation where we create good wishes for others -> mental habit of kindness. It feels like a good sentiment(pending on scale) to create good wishes for others however i do feel a bit hollow an empty about it if its just a "wish". No action follow through. However i do like the positive inclination and habit it brings.</p>

	<h3>Empathic listening</h3>
	<!-- what i hear you feel-->
	<p>Empathic listening works when someone is talking about there relationship problems to you. From personal experience i often  guess/assume how a person is feeling about there current relationship however it really is guessing/assuming as i have had no experience with it myself</p>

	<h3>Give an example of a "person praise" and a "process praise"</h3>

	<p> note to self: Wow ok this part of the chapter definately hit home </p>

	<p> your good at microing in starcraft 2 -> person praise</p>
	<p> Praising a fixed belief in natural/inherent skill</p>
	<p> you practiced hard on these build orders -> process praise</p>
	<p>Praising effort</p>
