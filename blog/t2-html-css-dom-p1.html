					how to interpret code to display websites".</li>
					<li>CSS stands for "Cascading Style Sheets". It is a set of rules that tell the computer 
					how to present a website(visually)</li>
					<li>DOM stands for "Document Object Model". It is the internal representation of the page in 
					a hierachical structure of nodes. It is best to think of it like a tree. html tags branching
					Head and body tags
					</li>
