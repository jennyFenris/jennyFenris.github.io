	<h3>How does Javascript compare to HTML and CSS?</h3>
	<p>All these languages are used for different purposes in the creation of a website</p><br>
	<p>You use javascript to create the content of the page, this means in HTML you define the basic structure(skeleton).</p><br>
	<p>E.g House blueprints</p>

	<p>CSS is responsible for the design of the webpage. How everything looks and where it is on the page.</p><br>
	<p>E.g Colour/style of the house</p>

	<p>Javascript is responsible for everything that has to change or get animated after the website loaded, for example you can create a button that makes text disappear when you click on it, you can nearly do anything with javascript, you even can load more data from the server, that you want to appear on the webpage.</p><br>
	<p>E.g the plumbing/sink/shower/toliet of the house</p><br>
	
	<h3>Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life, for example'waking up' or brushing your teeth'</h3>
	<p>A computer program can be thought of as a sequence of instructions which are followed by a computer to solve a problem. However, the sequence in which they are written and the sequence in which they are executed may not be the same.If the execution of every program was sequential, it would run exactly the same way each time. Hence, to write programs of greater complexity, which can take decisions based on user input or values of variables, we need a decision making mechanism which can alter the sequential order of execution of statements. The order of execution of statements in a program is called Control Flow (or flow of control).</p><br>

	<p>A real life example of this sort of "decision-making" could be: "If the traffic light is green, keep moving;if yellow, then wait; if red, then stop". In the case of programmming, "decision-making" essentially means deciding from which statement the execution should be resumed.</p><br>
	
	<h3>Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects literals</h3>
	<p></p>
	
	<h3>Explain what functions are and why they are useful</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Array is subclass, or sub-prototype, of "Object". So "Array" inherits all features from "Object".</li>
		<li>Array is not a new data type. Array and Object are sharing the same data type object.</li>
		<li>The typeof operator on an "Array" object returns object.</li>
		<li>The instanceof operator on an "Array" object matches Array. It also matches Object, because "Array" is a subclass of Object.</li>
		<li>An object of Object can have indexed properties using the same syntax as Array objects.</li>
		<li>An object of Object is not an object of Array.</li>
		<li>An object of Array is also an object of Object.</li>
		</ul>

	
	<h3>With an example, explain the differences between functional and object oriented programming</h3>
	<p>The biggest difference is that Object is about Control flow while Functional programming is about Data flow. Another way to say it is that functional programming only uses expressions while in imperative programming both expressions and statements are used.</p><br>

	<p>For example, in imperative programming variables and loops are common when handling state, while in functional programming the state is handled via parameter passing, which avoids side-effects and assignments.</p><br><br>

	<p>int sumList(List<int> list) {
    int sum = 0;
    for(int n = 0; n < list.size(); n++) {
        sum = sum + list.get(n);
    }

    return sum;
	}</p><br>

	<p>fun sumList([], sum) = sum
 |  sumList(v::lst, sum) = sumList(lst, v+sum)</p><br>
