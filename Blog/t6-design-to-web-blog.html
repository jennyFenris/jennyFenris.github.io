<h1>Design to Web Blog</h1>
<h3>What a responsive site is and why responsiveness is important?</h3>

A responsive website is a site that reshape/resizes its layout depending on the device or browser size it is being seen through. Responsive websites are important because of the growth of smartphones and tablets and other mobile devices. More people are using smaller screen devices to view Web pages.

<h3>What is mobile first design and why is it important?</h3>

In terms of mobile web design, this means that a full, standard website would scale back and gradually remove content and features as the viewport became smaller and the system simpler. It is important because it allows for easier/better experience when web browsing on a smaller device.

<h3>What are some frameworks and what are there pros and cons?</h3>

A framework is defined as a package made up of a structure of files and folders of standardized code (HTML, CSS, JS documents etc.) which can be used to support the development of websites, as a basis to start building a site. 

The aim of frameworks is to provide a common structure so that developers donâ€™t have to redo it from scratch and can reuse the code provided. In this way, frameworks allow us to cut out much of the work and save a lot of time.

E.g of frameworks

Bootstrap
Foundation 3
Skeleton
YAML 4
Tuktuk
Gumby
Kube
Groundwork

<h3>What is a wireframe and why do we use it?</h3>

A website wireframe is a skeletal framework of a website. It allows us to arrange Elements(boxes) in a way we see fit. Wireframe layout allows us to semantically structure our html/css

<h3>What aspects of your wireframes did you find difficult to implement and why?</h3>

I don't know why but i found aligning images/boxes horizontally together specifically how i wanted difficult. display: flex , inline, float. Trying to wrap my head around the "flow" was .... interesting. and not intially as straight foward as i thought it was going to be.

<h3>The accessibility/useability features you included in your site?</h3>

Colour scheme awareness for colour blindness
Poor Eyesight -> not making text too small
Contrasts -> text and background
Images -> alt text
Not making pages tooooooo dependant on images -> css Driven menu button system
Dividing sections into appropriate headings
