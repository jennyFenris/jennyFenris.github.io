				<h3>What is a grid based design</h3>
				
				<p>A grid at its barest is nothing more than a series of intesecting horizontal
				and vertical lines spaced at regular intervals, but its innate propensity for
				creating order out of chaose makes it one of the most powerful tools at a designer's 
				disposal.</p>
				
				<p>Grids enable you to build solid structure and form into your designs.
				Much like we looked at typographic hierarchies and rhythm, we can effectuate 
				the same feelings through using a grid structure. Just as with coding, there are 
				recommended ways to organise modules and sections of code, and a grid system can help
				similarly when designing for the web.</p>
				
				<h3>Whats all the hype about responsive webpages?</h3>
				
				<p>Responsive Web design is the approach that suggests that design and development should 
				respond to the users behavior and environment based on screen size, platform and orientation.
				The practice consists of a mix of flexible grids and layouts, images and an intelligent use
				of CSS media queries. As the user switches from their laptop to iPad, the website should
				automatically switch to accommodate for resolution, image size and scripting abilities.
				In other words, the website should have the technology to automatically respond to the
				users preferences. This would eliminate the need for a different design and development 
				phase for each new gadget on the market.</p>
				
				
					
				
			
				
				<h3>Semantic structure</h3>
				
				<p>Semantics are the implied meaning of a subject, like a word or sentence. It aids how humans
				(and these days, machines) interpret subject matter. On the web, HTML serves both humans and
				machines, suggesting the purpose of the content enclosed within an HTML tag. Since the dawn 
				of HTML, elements have been revised and adapted based on actual usage on the web, ideally so
				that authors can navigate markup with ease and create carefully structured documents, and so
				that machines can infer the context of the wonderful collection of data we humans can
				read.</p>
